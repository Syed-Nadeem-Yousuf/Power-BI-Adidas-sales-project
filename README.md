# Power-Bi-Adidas-sales-project
üöÄ Excited to share My Latest Project: Adidas Sales Analysis Dashboard using Power BI! 
üéØ Objectives:
The purpose of this project is to practice my Power BI skills using a sample dataset. Through this analysis, I focused on understanding sales dynamics, identifying regions with high and low sales potential, and gaining insights into product performance. This project allowed me to work with calculated fields, visualize key metrics, and develop insights into pricing, margins, and overall sales performance‚Äîall essential for honing my data analysis skills.
üìÅ Data Source:
The dataset was taken from Kaggle, in xlsx format. The data was cleaned and was ready to be taken into Power BI for the analysis.
‚öí Data Processing:
Some of the few major steps I undertook to prepare my data for final analysis are as follows:
‚Ä¢	Loaded clean data into Power BI.
‚Ä¢	Created calculated fields to include operational cost and operational profit margin.
üîë Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
For the analysis, I identified some KPIs:

‚Ä¢	Total Sales
‚Ä¢	Total Cost
‚Ä¢	Operational Profit
‚Ä¢	Operational Profit Margin
‚Ä¢	Unit sold
‚Ä¢	Average- price per unit
üìä Charts and Insights:
I have supplemented the sales data of Adidas with visualizations to extract insights. Some key insights from these visualizations are as follows:
‚Ä¢	Donut Chart: This showcased the regional sales performance. It was clear that out of the total sales, 30% originated from the West region, which points to a new growth avenue.
‚Ä¢	Bar Graph: Designated Men's Street Shoes to be the best seller, while Women's Athletic Shoes to be the low seller which required careful focus.
‚Ä¢	Shape Map: Utilized filling colours to indicate the number of sales in the state level, thus was established that the sales were highest in New York and seconded by California then Texas followed by Florida.
‚Ä¢	Area Graph: Established proof that July, August, and December had the highest sales, thus the peak months which correlates with the peak shopping periods.
‚Ä¢	Column Chart: Remarks on Retail Sales; the firm sold the highest amount of West Gear, while that was the lowest at Amazon and Walmart.

Conclusion
The Adidas Sales Analysis Dashboard provided valuable insights on how to optimize sales and profit across different dimensions. Although this was a practice project using a sample dataset, it helped me understand the impact of pricing, margins, and regional performance. These insights could guide strategic decisions in real-world scenarios to ensure profitability and maintain market competitiveness. This practice enhanced my ability to analyse sales data and create actionable recommendations using Power BI.
